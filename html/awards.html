            </div>
                <p>Lionel Messi has became the first man in history to win the Golden Ball twice at the FIFA World Cup. He also previously won the 2014 world cup golden boot hosted by Brazil. This world cup will probably be his last and he achieved the important title any footballer achieved.</p>

                <span>French</span>
            </div>
                <p>He is probably the most decorate youngest player. He won the silver boot for his outstanding performance in the final carrying his team alone. This is his second silver boot. He won the previous world cup. Evenough he didn't won this years world cup he already have done it at 19.</p>
            </div>

            </div>
                <p>Previous Golden boot award taker Luka Modric is still performing at age 37. He recieved the previous golden boot after reaching the final with less experienced players. This year world cup his country finished 3rd year.</p>

            </div>
                <p>Kylian Mbappe has already 2 golden boot at the world cup. This is a great achievent for a 23 year old boy. He scored a hatrick at the final making him the second player to do so. Unfortunatley he could not get his hand to the world-cup this year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "trophy">

            </div>
                <p>Beside from winning the golden boot, he also finished this world cup as a top second goal-scorer. He joined the top 10 league of goal-scorer of the world-cup. Not only the he is also the best playmaker for his country</p>

                <span>French</span>
            </div>
                <p>Olivier Girud is either one of the luckiest player or most talented player. He never plays well in the pitch but he always delivers to score. He was crucial for the france in 2018 and 2022 world cup</p>
            </div>

            </div>
                <p>Emi Martinez hero of the world cup final. If it were not for him, Argentina's and Messi's dream would be dead. He saved penalty shoutout in the quarter final. And his final he repeated it in the final saving 2 penalities and helping his team won the world cup.</p>
