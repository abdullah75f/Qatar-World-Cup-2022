        <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations, and the 22nd FIFA World Cup. It is took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, making it the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is currently the most expensive World Cup ever held; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion, and other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010. The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.</p>

            <p>Argentina were crowned champions of the word after defeating the defending champions France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986. In the final game Kylian Mbappe scored a hatrick and become the second player to do so. He also become the youngest player to reach 13 goals in the world cup. Lionel Messi finally won the most important title after 5 world cup trials.</p>
